# Algorithm Visualizer

An interactive platform built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS to visualize various algorithms like sorting, searching, graph, and tree algorithms. This project aims to provide a clear, step-by-step understanding of how these algorithms work through engaging animations and a modern user interface.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive Landing Page**: A modern, animated introduction to the visualizer.
- **Algorithm Categories**:
  - Sorting (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
  - Searching (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search)
  - Graph Algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's, A\*)
  - Tree Algorithms (e.g., Traversals, Balancing)
- **Step-by-step Visualization**: Clearly see each step of the algorithm execution.
- **Control Panel**: Adjust animation speed, input data, and other parameters.
- **Responsive Design**: Works smoothly on various screen sizes.
- **Dark Mode**: Switch between light and dark themes for comfortable viewing.
- **Modern Aesthetics**: Clean UI with smooth animations using Framer Motion.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Linting**: ESLint
- **Package Manager**: npm

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.x or higher recommended)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sands21/algo-visualizer.git
   cd algo-visualizer
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will typically open the application in your default browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

### Building for Production

To create a production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## üìñ How to Use

1.  Navigate to the landing page to get an overview of the available algorithm categories.
2.  Click on "Start Exploring" or select a specific algorithm category (Sorting, Searching, Graph, Tree) from the navigation or the cards.
3.  On an algorithm page:
    - Select a specific algorithm from the dropdown menu.
    - (If applicable) Input your own data or use the randomly generated data.
    - Adjust the visualization speed using the slider.
    - Click the "Visualize" or "Start" button to begin the animation.
    - Observe the step-by-step execution of the algorithm.
    - Use the control buttons (play, pause, reset) as needed.
